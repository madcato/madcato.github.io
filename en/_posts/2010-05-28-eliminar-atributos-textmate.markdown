[Macromates](http://manual.macromates.com/en/saving_files.html)  

To eliminate the extended attributes of **Textmate** execute the following command on Terminal: 

	defaults write com.macromates.textmate OakDocumentDisableFSMetaData 1  

This will eliminate the **@** of the permissions of the files, those which we can see executing `ls -al` (-rw-r--r--@)
Also this will allow to copy this files to systems that doesn't suppport extended attributes (like Samba), and not see files ***._filename*** created at all.
