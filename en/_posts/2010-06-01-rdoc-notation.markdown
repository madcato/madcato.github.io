 # put notes or messages here (like FIXMEs or TODOs, that will not  
 # end up in your documenation.

 # denote +code_word+ to appear as typewritter with pluses.  
 #  
 # A lot of people write their options out like this:  
 #  
 # :option -- description of what to pass  
 #  
 # class Indented  
 # def text(appears)  
 # as code  
 # end  
 # end
