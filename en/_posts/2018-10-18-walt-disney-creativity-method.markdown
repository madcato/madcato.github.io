## The three minds

Walt Disney used three different minds. Every time hw wanted to solve a problem, thoughts in that problem using three different point of view. Each of this points of view corresponds with one kind of mind:

- The **dreamer** mind.
- The **critical** mind.
- The **realistic** mind.

## Method

First you have to imagine to hava a dreamer mind and **discover everything** that can be done, then you have to have a realistic mind to **make your discovery**, to finally have a critical mind to **sift the results** of the other two processes.

You have to be careful not to spend too much time in one of the three states.

## How to apply it

1. Choose a problem or dream.
2. Imagine three rooms: one for a **dreamer**, one for a **realist** and one for a "pooper" **critic**.
3. Pass that problem or dream through the three rooms.
4. Phase of **dreams**. Let your imagination fly to any strange nook and cranny you can think of, do not limit yourself, **be always positive**, imagine that there are no limits. Write results. This phase discovers the *why*.
5. **Realistic** phase. Plan and look for ways to bring the ideas **discovered** in the previous phase to fruition, if possible. This phase defines the *how*.
6. **Critical** phase. Find what is missing, estimate if it is **achievable**, avoid being too destructive, but always balancing the positive from the negative. This phase define the *what*.
