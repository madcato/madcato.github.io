# Best videos of the WWDC

Anual Apple Developer Conference

## 1. WWDC'10, Session 103: iPad and iPhone User Interface Design (iOS)

This information is basic in order to produce a good app with a relevant design. Great tutorial explaining a practical technique to analyze and develop a good user interface.

[Watch SD](https://download.developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc_2010__sd/session_103__ipad_and_iphone_user_interface_design.mov) Requires apple developer account.

## 2. WWDC'18, Session 223: Embracing Algorithms

This session explains, in a entertaining way, the importance of algorithms. Using algorithms not only improves the efficiency of the execution, also improves the legibility of the code, and also, its reusability. Good advise from an old school programmer is: "Don't use for loops ever."
