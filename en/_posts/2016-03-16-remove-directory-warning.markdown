I solved this warning removing the following setting: "$(SDKROOT)/Developer/Library/Frameworks"
This options is located in Settings -> Build Settings -> Search Paths -> Framework Search Paths

![Setting location]({{ site.url}}/assets/setting-location.png)

My project continues compiling and working fine, after removing this option.
