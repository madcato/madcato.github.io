There is some bug in **iOS4** when calling **NSURLConnection** from a thead different from the main one. To solve this issue use the following code:  

	//iOS 4 bug fix  
	if (![NSThread isMainThread]) {  
		[self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(start)  
		withObject:nil waitUntilDone:NO];  
		return;  
	}
