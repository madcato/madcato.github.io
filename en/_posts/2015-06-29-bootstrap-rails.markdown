Actually you don't need gem for this, here is the step to install Bootstrap 3 in RoR

* [Download](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v3.0.0/bootstrap-3.0.0-dist.zip) Bootstrap
* Copy:    

bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css and bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css

To: vendor/assets/stylesheets

* Copy:     

bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js and bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js

To: vendor/assets/javascripts

* Update: app/assets/stylesheets/application.css by adding:
{% highlight css %}
*= require bootstrap.min
{% endhighlight %}

* Update: app/assets/javascripts/application.jsby adding:
{% highlight css %}
//= require bootstrap.min
{% endhighlight %}

With this you can update bootstrap any time you want, don't need to wait gem to be updated. Also with this approach assets pipeline will use minified versions in production.
