  To optimize space, **eliminate common words and stop words** that don't significantly contribute to your visibility.
4. **Avoid Including Your App or Company Name**  
  Avoid redundancies and use each character wisely. **Don't include your app, company name, or category** in search terms.
5. **Simplify Complicated Words**  
  Facilitate user searches. **Simplify complicated words** to make your application more accessible.
6. **Use All 100 Characters Available**  
  Every character counts. **Utilize all 100 characters** available to maximize your application's visibility.

- **Study Competitors:** Learn from others. **Analyze your competitors** and take note of their strategies.
- **Continuous Optimization:** ASO is an iterative process. **Invest in tracking** to continually adjust your strategy.
