If you want to merge two branches- but don't want to keep separated banches and fix the messages of branch-, you can use an **interactive rebase**. 

Using **rebase**, branches aren't maintained in the repository. Using rebase you can move one branch to the top of another.

But **git-rebase** has another fantastic feature: **interactive rebase**. With this type of **rebase** you can edit commit messages, even mix several commits into one. This is very useful to keep a well documented **git log** without noise.

To use this method, first checkout the branch you want to rebase(the secondary branch). Then select the last commit of destination branch(the main one).

**To avoid merge conflicts is very, very important to apply command "Squash with previous commit..." always on top of the commit list after rebase. After all the *Squash* the commits must by ordered**

## Final result

Only one thread, only one commit message. Cheers!!!
