<p>iOS Developer, skeptic, dreamer. I believe in science, knowledge and power of human mind. Trying to survive the world with a self-esteem of 0.5 out of 10</p>

<p>I started developing software at age of 8. I've worked for many software companies. My objective is to work for myself. Not as a freelance, but as manager of my own business.</p>
