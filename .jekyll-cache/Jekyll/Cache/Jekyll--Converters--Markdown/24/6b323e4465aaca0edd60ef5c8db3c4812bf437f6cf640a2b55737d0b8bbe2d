I"p<p>Tesla could become the largest company in the world. Even reaching a stock market valuation higher than the rest of the companies in the world together. The reason is that one of his projects is a humanoid robot called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Bot">Optimus (or Tesla Bot)</a>, which could become the most purchased product in the history of the humanity. <strong>Imagine having a robot at home that cleans your house, prepares your food, or even goes down to buy</strong>. We would pay real bullshit money to have something like that. The price of such a product could easily equal that of a car.</p>
