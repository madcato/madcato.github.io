<p>To operate the location of the iPhone in any way <strong>background</strong> should use the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Activate the file project.plist the next value: <strong>UIBackgroundModes</strong>: Array =&gt; <strong>location</strong></li>
  <li>Implement an CLLocationManagerDelegate intarface and enable tracing with one of two methods:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges</strong>
The problem with this method is that you throw few updates: only when there is a change in cell mobile telephony. The good thing is that it consumes little battery power.</li>
      <li><strong>startUpdatingLocation</strong>
By using this method is very important correctly configure the following variables:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>desiredAccuracy</strong> =&gt; precision</li>
          <li><strong>distanceFilter</strong> =&gt; Setting <strong>kCLDistanceFilterNone</strong> will be received position updates. Not recommended, unless high accuracy is required.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>To avoid using too much battery life is better <strong>desiredAccuracy</strong> put a larger one. For example 100 m. for displaced receive updates every 100 m.</p>
