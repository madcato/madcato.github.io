<h2 id="the-three-minds">The three minds</h2>

<p>Walt Disney used three different minds. Every time hw wanted to solve a problem, thoughts in that problem using three different point of view. Each of this points of view corresponds with one kind of mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <strong>dreamer</strong> mind.</li>
  <li>The <strong>critical</strong> mind.</li>
  <li>The <strong>realistic</strong> mind.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<p>First you have to imagine to hava a dreamer mind and <strong>discover everything</strong> that can be done, then you have to have a realistic mind to <strong>make your discovery</strong>, to finally have a critical mind to <strong>sift the results</strong> of the other two processes.</p>

<p>You have to be careful not to spend too much time in one of the three states.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply-it">How to apply it</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Choose a problem or dream.</li>
  <li>Imagine three rooms: one for a <strong>dreamer</strong>, one for a <strong>realist</strong> and one for a ‚Äúpooper‚Äù <strong>critic</strong>.</li>
  <li>Pass that problem or dream through the three rooms.</li>
  <li>Phase of <strong>dreams</strong>. Let your imagination fly to any strange nook and cranny you can think of, do not limit yourself, <strong>be always positive</strong>, imagine that there are no limits. Write results. This phase discovers the <em>why</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Realistic</strong> phase. Plan and look for ways to bring the ideas <strong>discovered</strong> in the previous phase to fruition, if possible. This phase defines the <em>how</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Critical</strong> phase. Find what is missing, estimate if it is <strong>achievable</strong>, avoid being too destructive, but always balancing the positive from the negative. This phase define the <em>what</em>.</li>
</ol>
