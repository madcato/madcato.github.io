  <li>iPhone 3GS 320x480</li>
  <li>iPhone 4 640x960</li>
  <li>iPad 1024x768</li>
  <li>iPad Retina 2048x1536</li>
</ul>

<p>For a control to be ‚Äútouchable‚Äù must at least have a 6x6 mm zone only for that control: in a 3GS iPhone is a about 44x44 px.</p>

<p>This doesn‚Äôt means that the control must have at least 44x44 px: means that no other control can be in that space: you can create a 1x1 button. And also it doesn‚Äôt mean that this size is a recommendation. This size is the minimal size for a touchable control, but is not a comfortable one.</p>

<p>Navigation bar height: 44 pixels Tab bar: 49 pixels</p>
