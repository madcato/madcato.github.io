I"L<p>Writing code is comfortable to use a keyboard configured in english(<strong>US Extended</strong>). But If you get used to use this mode, is hard to use the spanish keyboard at the same time to write in spanish. Thus, the best is to get use to this english keyboard uniquely and use it always even when writing spanish texts.</p>
