I"·<p>During my college years I suffered from - or should I say, enjoyed from- several obsessions. One of them was discovering the difference between what was called a ‚Äúsoftware design‚Äù and a ‚Äúsoftware analysis‚Äù. I read and read a multitude of computer design and analysis books, but I couldn‚Äôt resolve my doubts: in some books they called analysis, in others the same thing is called design. In none of those books did I find the difference between these terms. If I became obsessed with them, it was due to some books, or courses that I took, where the phases of software development were specified: from requirement collection, to the coding, they went through several stages: two of those stages were analysis and design.</p>
