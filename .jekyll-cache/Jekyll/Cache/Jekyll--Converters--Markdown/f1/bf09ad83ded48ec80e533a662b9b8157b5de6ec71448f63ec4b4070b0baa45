I"Ÿ<p>In Xcode 4 the default preferences specify a build output directory different from de Xcode 3 one. You can change this configuration and let the Xcode works as before. Open Xcode 4 and go to Preferences -&gt; Locations and change â€œBuild locationâ€.</p>

<p>If you want to use the current recommended configuration, you must know how to build and find the release binary: Build the project with option â€œProduct -&gt; Build For -&gt; Build for Archivingâ€ Then go to path <em>~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData//Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/</em></p>
